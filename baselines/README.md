## Two baselines: [DialogueRNN](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4657) and [DialogueGCN](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1015/) for MRC module.

We adopt DialogueRNN and DialogueGCN as our baselines. These two models are originally designed for sentiment classification. To adapt them to our task, we replace DADgraphâ€™s internal models with these models, but hold fixed the same final MRC module and BERT-based utterance representations.

**DialogueRNN**. DialogueRNN is a sequential neural network model for representing multiparty dialogues on emotion recognition for conversations task with two bidirectional
GRUs: a global GRU and a party GRU.

**DialogueGCN**. Compared to DialogueRNN, DialogueGCN model the context windows of an utterance in the dialogue as a graph and represent the graph using the GCN model.
