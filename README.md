* Abstract: Multiparty Dialogue Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) differs from traditional MRC as models must handle the complex dialogue discourse structure, previously unconsidered in traditional MRC. To fully exploit such discourse structure in multiparty dialogue, we present a discourse-aware dialogue graph neural network, DADgraph, which explicitly constructs the dialogue graph using discourse dependency links and discourse relations. To validate our model, we perform experiments on the Molweni corpus, a large-scale MRC dataset built over multiparty dialogue annotated with discourse structure. Experiments on Molweni show that our discourse-aware model achieves statistically significant improvements compared against strong neural network MRC baselines.

* Dataset: [Molweni corpus](https://github.com/hit-scir/molweni).

### Two dialogue models: [DialogueRNN](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4657) and [DialogueGCN](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1015/) with MRC module.

We adopt DialogueRNN and DialogueGCN as our baselines. These two models are originally designed for sentiment classification. To adapt them to our task, we replace DADgraphâ€™s internal models with these models but hold fixed the same final MRC module and BERT-based utterance representations.

**DialogueRNN**. DialogueRNN is a sequential neural network model for representing multiparty dialogues on emotion recognition for conversations task with two bidirectional
GRUs: a global GRU and a party GRU.

**DialogueGCN**. Compared to DialogueRNN, DialogueGCN model the context windows of an utterance in the dialogue as a graph and represent the graph using the GCN model.
